Linear Regression for Profit Prediction

1. Overview: This project implements a linear regression model to predict profits for a food franchise based on the population size of a city. It demonstrates the basic concepts of machine learning, including cost function computation, gradient descent optimization, and making predictions using the trained model.

2. Features:
i. Linear Regression: Utilizes a single-variable linear regression model to predict profits.
ii. Gradient Descent: Employs gradient descent to optimize the model's parameters.
iii. Visualization: Plots data and regression line for visual analysis.

3. Dataset:
The dataset contains:
x_train: Population of various cities (in 10,000s).
y_train: Profit for a food franchise in those cities (in $10,000s).
Negative profit values indicate a loss.

4. Usage:

i. Data Visualization: Initial plotting of the dataset to understand the distribution of data.
ii. Cost Function: Implementation of the cost function to evaluate the model's performance.
iii. Gradient Descent: Optimization of model parameters using gradient descent.
iv. Prediction: Estimation of profits based on city population sizes.

5. Requirements:
Python 3
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For plotting the dataset and regression line.

6. Instructions:
To run the notebook:

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
Open the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially.

7. Example Predictions:
For a city with a population of 35,000, the model predicts a profit of approximately $4519.77.
For a city with a population of 70,000, the model predicts a profit of approximately $45342.45.

8. Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the fundamental steps involved in building and applying a linear regression model, including data visualization, cost function computation, parameter optimization using gradient descent, and making predictions.
